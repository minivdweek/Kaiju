/**
 * Go! Protocol
 *
 * The client makes a connnection to the server via a Socket. The client and the server communicate via messages that
 * are Strings. Messages are of the following format:
 *
 * COMMAND ARG1 ARG2 ARG3
 *
 * where the arguments are separated by spaces and the number of arguments is command specific. This is a line based
 * protocol, such that every combination of command and arguments is on a new line.
 *
 * The server port should be configurable. By default the server will use port 1929 to wait for connecting clients. The
 * Server has to determine the board size, such that clients that connect to the server will automatically play the
 * boardsize determined by the server. Possible boardsizes are 9, 13 and 19 and it is assumed that the client supports
 * these.
 *
 * The server has the responsibility to keep track of the game state, that includes what stones are one the board,
 * how many captives of each color there are, whose turn it is, how many subsequent passes have occurred. The server
 * also has the responsibility to determine whether or not a move is valid. If a move is not valid, it will allow the
 * client to choose another move.
 *
 * If the client sends a command to the server that is not part of the protocol, the server may close the connection and
 * end the game. If the client sends a command that is part of the protocol, but not supported by the server, the server
 * may not close the connection. If the server sends a non- supported command to the client, the client should continue
 * as normal. If connection to a client is lost or a client is not responsive for more than 60 seconds, the server ends
 * the game and informs the players of this.
 *
 * At this moment, we end the game if two players consecutively pass. How to deal with an appropriate game ending has to
 * be further elaborated.
